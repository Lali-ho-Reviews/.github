# Lali-Ho Reviews

### The purpose

The website aims to provide a hub for Final Fantasy XIV players to find Free Companies that match their interests, as well as be able to post or read reviews from previous and current members.

In this context, a “Free Company” (FC) in Final Fantasy XIV (FFXIV) is analogous to a guild or clan in any other game, in that it is essentially a social club for like minded members.

### Target audience

The target audience of this site would be primarily made up of players of the relevant game, but from that group could include users looking to join a FC,  FC looking to voice their opinions, and even FC Leaders  looking for feedback.

## Deployed site (coming soon)
