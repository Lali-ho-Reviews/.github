# Lali-ho Reviews

The website aims to provide a hub for users to find in-game Free Companies that match their interests, as well as being able to post or read reviews from previous and current members.

## Functionality:
- Search Guilds by:
  1. Name
  2. Category
  3. Ranking
- Import new Free Companies from the FFXIV API
- View guild details, reviews and ratings
- Post reviews of existing guilds
- Optional sign up/log in for users
- At least a basic admin view for moderation
- (Maybe) User profile view to see entire post history
- (Maybe) “Like” reviews


The target audience of this site would be primarily made up of players of the relevant game, but from that group could include users looking to join a guild, guild members looking to voice their opinions, and even Guild Masters looking for feedback.
